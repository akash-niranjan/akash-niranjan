Where is my coffee!?
~I am Akash Niranjan, I am in my senior year of high school a.k.a. 12th Class, and I live to make ideal programs up to the exact requirements.
~My logical abilities are modestly good and my knowledge in coding is about average for my age group ( leave out the prodigies ).
~I do Python and have rusty html and CSS skills too, but that's more than enough for my current age, or so preach my elders.
